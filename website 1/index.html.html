      <h2>Adoption</h2>
      
      In this section, the adoption section this is where individuals who may be willing to give one of our animals a new home can look through to see what animals may want to be given new homes. 

      <p>We at Compassionate Critters believe in looking after and caring about our animals to the upmost standard, so we thought we should entail to those who aren't aware about what responsible pet ownership would entail:</p>
      
      <p>Firstly we believe that the essentials such as providing your critter with shelter, nutritious food and clean water aswell as vaccinations against harmful diseases are up to date.</p>

      <p>Next we believe that having your pet exercise helps not only its physical and mental health but also yours as an owner, teaching your pet tricks and enforcing good behaviour due to it helps train your pet. </p>

      <p>Letting your pet socialise with other animals of its species can be good for them and help them to get used to other members of its species, grooming your pet is also anothe essential such as brushing their fur or washing them regularly.</p>
